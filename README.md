This Repository was created to create an implementation using RustworkX Python Library to create, filter, and visualize a Graph.
____
All main files are in the src directory including the rxGraspi.py file, which holds the code to creating, filtering, and visualizing graphs, as well as two additional directory's: test and images directory.
Add all tests in given test directory with proper formatting starting with the "x, y, z" dimensions in that order and format then a newline and fill graph based on Graspi documentation, follow link for more details: https://owodolab.github.io/graspi/inputFormats.html
______
***DOWNLOADS NEEDED***
You will need to download 2-3 packages
1. rustworkx package (used 15.1 version)
2. graphviz
3. matplotlib

As according to rustworkx documentation, it is recommended to use graphviz for graphs with a lot of nodes and matplotlib for smaller graphs. Our implementation has two functions for visualizing a graph with both but focuses on the rest of the project
with graphviz, this is due to the fact we are working with bigger graphs.
